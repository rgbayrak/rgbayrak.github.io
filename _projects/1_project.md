In this drawing class, we explored composite and collage drawing techniques. The approach involves combining unrelated elements into a single image, creating unexpected visual combinations.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/fun/drawing/knight_full.jpg" title="Knight hugging a cloud" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/fun/drawing/knight.jpg" title="Knight hugging a cloud" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    A knight hugging a cloud.
</div>

The drawing depicts a knight embracing a cloud. This type of composite imagery brings together two distinct subjects—an armored figure and an atmospheric form—into a single scene.

Collage techniques have a rich history in art, particularly within Surrealism, where artists combined disparate images to create dreamlike scenes. In drawing, this approach allows for playful or imaginative pairings.
