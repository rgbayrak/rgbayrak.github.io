A self-portrait created using the grid technique. This method involves dividing both the reference image and the drawing surface into equal squares, making it easier to accurately transfer proportions and placement.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/fun/drawing/self1.jpg" title="Reference with grid" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/fun/drawing/self2.jpg" title="Drawing with grid" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

The grid technique breaks down the image into smaller, manageable sections. By focusing on one square at a time, it becomes easier to observe shapes and relationships without getting overwhelmed by the whole face.

### On the difficulty of self-portraiture

Creating a self-portrait is surprisingly challenging, and not just technically. Spending extended time studying your own face can be an uncomfortable experience. It requires confronting how you actually look versus how you imagine yourself, which can bring up unexpected emotions.

Many artists find self-portraiture demanding and not just technically. There's also the strange disconnect of being both the observer and the observed. As <a href="https://blog.artweb.com/how-to/how-to-do-a-self-portrait/">ArtWeb article on self-portraiture</a> questions, is it the bravest form of art? 

That said, the process can also be valuable. It builds patience and self-acceptance. "Self-portraiture can be an excellent tool for self-awareness and self-portraits can be a journey towards increased self-knowledge" [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aip.2007.05.002">Simone Alter Muri</a>].
