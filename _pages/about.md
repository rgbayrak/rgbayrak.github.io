I am a Senior Research Engineer and Research Assistant Professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/). My research focuses on large-scale neuroimaging data analysis. During and since my PhD, I have developed individual specific computational approaches to improve precision in brain mapping.

I have expertise and publication track record in:

- multivariate time series modeling and analysis for brain-body research,
- interactive data visualization and analysis,
- graph-based advanced machine learning, and
- diffusion tractography.

I was advised by and presently collaborate with Prof. [Catie Chang](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/?pid=catie-chang).

As founder and general chair of [BrainHack Vanderbilt](http://brainhack-vandy.github.io), I drive the organization's strategic vision while championing open science principles. My commitment to collaborative research extends through leadership roles in key neuroscience initiatives, including the Organization for Human Brain Mapping's [Open Science Special Interest Group](https://ossig.netlify.app), [PhysioPy](https://github.com/physiopy), and [BrainHack School](https://school-brainhack.github.io/). My work is deeply influenced by and incorporates best practices in [reproducible research](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/reproducible-research) and [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science).
