  abstract={Detecting human vigilance states (e.g., natural shifts between alertness and drowsiness) from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can provide novel insight into the whole-brain patterns underlying these critical states. Moreover, as a person’s vigilance levels are closely tied to their behavior and brain activity, vigilance state can strongly influence the results of fMRI studies. Therefore, the ability to annotate fMRI scans with vigilance information can also enable clearer and more robust results in fMRI research. However, well-established vigilance indicators are derived from other modalities such as behavioral responses, electroencephalography (EEG), and pupillometry, which are not typically available in fMRI data collection. While previous works indicate the promise of distinguishing vigilance states from fMRI alone, EEG data can provide reliable vigilance indicators that complement and augment fMRI domain information. Here, we propose CBrain: Cross-modal learning for Brain vigilance detection in resting-state fMRI. Our model transfers EEG vigilance information into an fMRI latent space in training, and predicts human vigilance states using only fMRI data in testing, addressing the need for external vigilance indicators. Experimental results demonstrate CBrain’s ability to predict vigilance states across different individuals at a granularity of 10-fMRI-frames with an 81.07% mF1 score on a test set of unseen subjects. Additionally, our generalization experiments highlight the model’s potential to estimate vigilance in an unseen task and in resting-state fMRI scans collected with a different scanner at a different site.},

  abstract={Many studies of the human brain using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) lack physiological measurements, which substantially impacts the interpretation and richness of fMRI studies. Natural fluctuations in autonomic physiology, such as breathing and heart rate, provide windows into critical functions, including cognition, emotion, and health, and can heavily influence fMRI signals. Here, we developed DeepPhysioRecon, a Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM)-based network that decodes continuous variations in respiration amplitude and heart rate directly from whole-brain fMRI dynamics. Through systematic evaluations, we investigate the generalizability of this approach across datasets and experimental conditions. We also demonstrate the importance of including these measures in fMRI analyses. This work highlights the importance of studying brain-body interactions, proposes a tool that may enhance the efficacy of fMRI as a biomarker, and provides widely applicable open-source software.}

  abstract={The coupling between functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and autonomic physiological processes is not merely “noise”, but captures important brain-body interactions. This relationship is likely bidirectional: autonomic fluctuations can influence brain activity and hemodynamics, and neuronal activity can modulate systemic physiological processes. This complexity makes it difficult for traditional linear approaches to fully characterize their relationship. Here, we introduce a novel application of vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to characterize whole-brain patterns associated with respiration using the discretized fMRI latent space. Further, we demonstrate that this framework can be leveraged to assess the quality of fMRI-based reconstructions of low-frequency respiratory fluctuations when physiological recordings are missing or corrupted. The success of our model indicates that we can extract the non-linear relationship between the fMRI brain signals and bodily autonomic processes, revealing their intrinsic connections in the cross-modal latent space.}

  abstract={Machine learning provides a valuable tool for analyzing high-dimensional functional neuroimaging data, and is proving effective in predicting various neurological conditions, psychiatric disorders, and cognitive patterns. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research, interactions between brain regions are commonly modeled using graph-based representations. The potency of graph machine learning methods has been established across myriad domains, marking a transformative step in data interpretation and predictive modeling. Yet, despite their promise, the transposition of these techniques to the neuroimaging domain has been challenging due to the expansive number of potential preprocessing pipelines and the large parameter search space for graph-based dataset construction. In this paper, we introduce NeuroGraph, a collection of graph-based neuroimaging datasets, and demonstrated its utility for predicting multiple categories of behavioral and cognitive traits. We delve deeply into the dataset generation search space by crafting 35 datasets that encompass static and dynamic brain connectivity, running in excess of 15 baseline methods for benchmarking. Additionally, we provide generic frameworks for learning on both static and dynamic graphs. Our extensive experiments lead to several key observations. Notably, using correlation vectors as node features, incorporating larger number of regions of interest, and employing sparser graphs lead to improved performance. To foster further advancements in graph-based data driven neuroimaging analysis, we offer a comprehensive open-source Python package that includes the benchmark datasets, baseline implementations, model training, and standard evaluation.}

  abstract={Since functional MRI (fMRI) is based on measurements of blood oxygenation it is influenced not only by changes in neural activity, but also by any bodily physiological processes that modulate blood oxygenation. These processes may confound the measurement of certain neural features with fMRI, but at the same time, they can also provide useful windows into critical functions including cognition, emotion, and health. To this end, it is beneficial to monitor physiological activity during fMRI acquisition (e.g., by recording cardiac activity, chest compression, O2/CO2 gas levels, and skin conductance). Indeed, there is a growing interest in physiological data collection in the neuroimaging community. To expand and facilitate the use of physiological data, we created physiopy, a community-driven effort aimed to offer end-to-end pipelines for collecting, correcting, and using physiological recordings. Physiopy leverages the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) protocol and thrives on building consensus on 'community practices' among researchers in an open, transparent, and reproducible manner. The four pillars of the physiopy project are (i) suite of easily usable software, (ii) clear documentation, (iii) best practices based on consensus, and (iv) community of users, developers, and researchers interested in physiology.}
