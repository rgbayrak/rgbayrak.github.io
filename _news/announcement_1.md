This year I have 3 abstracts in the <a href="https://www.humanbrainmapping.org">OHBM Annual Meeting</a>. :nerd_face:

One oral presentation, presenting our community efforts <a href="https://github.com/physiopy">PhysioPy</a>.

Two poster presentations featuring
(1) the latest updates on Physio Patterns, and
(2) a fresh-out-of-the-oven project PhysioQA.
