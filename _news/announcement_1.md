This year I have 3 abstracts in the [OHBM Annual Meeting](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=1). :nerd_face:

One oral presentation, presenting our community efforts [PhysioPy](https://github.com/physiopy).

Two poster presentations featuring
(1) the latest updates on Physio Patterns, and
(2) a fresh-out-of-the-oven project PhysioQA.
